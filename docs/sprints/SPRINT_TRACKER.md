# Sprint Tracker

Velocity log. One row per completed F-ID, appended by `/complete-feature`, plus
a per-sprint summary appended by `/close-sprint`.

Estimates come from `docs/hld/14-development-backlog.md`. Actuals are recorded
so the velocity assumption can be corrected against reality rather than
defended.

`S = 1d`, `M = 2-3d`, `L = 4-5d`, `XL = split me`.

## Velocity

Recalculated at each sprint close. The backlog assumes about 2 stories per week
sustained, and the whole plan is sized at roughly 390 developer-days. If the
first three sprints diverge from that by more than 30 percent, replan rather
than absorb it.

Stories per week is completed stories divided by actual days, multiplied by
five working days.

| 2026-08-16 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S41 | Record 7 actual days against 12 estimated. Splitting F-X013 into three children at design time meant each arrived with its defect already isolated, and five of the six stories shared one note or drawing subsystem, so later stories reused the first one's investigation rather than repeating it |
| 2026-08-16 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S43 | Record 1 actual day against 8 estimated. Every story arrived with its defect already isolated by the sprint that filed it, so design read a written-up cause rather than searching for one. Retain the dependency-defined boundaries. The 25.00 stories per week this produces is not a sustainable rate and is not carried into any forecast |
| 2026-08-16 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S44 | Record 4 actual days against 6 estimated. Three stories reused the existing workflow-contract module, and two reused already pinned CI environments, which reduced implementation time while preserving the dependency-defined boundaries and full close gate |
| 2026-08-17 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S45 | Record 4 actual days against 10 estimated. The format-neutral chart engine already existed, and the strict dependency chain reused one shared authoring path and one golden fixture across the later stories. Retain the milestone-defined boundaries |

| 2026-08-25 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S56 | Record 1 actual day against 15 estimated. Isolated workers, established exporter and release workflows, and the v0.10.1 recovery allowed implementation, review, and publication work to overlap safely. The resulting 30.00 stories per week is not a sustainable forecast, so retain the dependency-defined future release checkpoints starting at S58 |
| 2026-08-25 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S57 | Record 1 actual day against 10 estimated. Isolated workers, established corpus and oracle infrastructure, and test-only reuse of existing render paths reduced delivery time while preserving the dependency-defined S58 shaping boundary.

| 2026-09-01 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S63 | Record 1 actual day against 20 estimated. Retained F-220 evidence, established interchange and rendering paths, and tightly scoped cache fixes reduced repeated investigation while the bounded reviews preserved exact behavior. The resulting 30.00 stories per week is not a sustainable forecast, so retain milestone-defined future sprint boundaries |
| 2026-09-03 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S64 | Record 2 actual days against 12 estimated. Isolated import and release worktrees, established external oracles, and retained milestone evidence allowed implementation, publication, and review to overlap safely.

| 2026-09-26 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S75 | Record 8 actual days against 47 originally estimated, with 36 estimated days moved to S76 in the approved eight-story carry. The three delivered stories were estimated at 11 days and took 8. This is a deliberate mid-milestone scope cutoff, not evidence that the remaining related-story work became cheaper. The resulting 1.88 stories per week is close to the long-run assumption, so retain the dependency-defined S76 boundary and split it before implementation if capacity requires |
| 2026-09-30 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S76 | Record 2 elapsed workdays against 15 estimated for three completed contribution waves. Stacked PRs reused established implementation and oracle paths, while dependency-prefix review and full verification remained explicit.

Reviewed contributor changes, source-built acceptance matrices and the established full gate compressed elapsed time. The resulting 15.00 stories per week is not a sustainable forecast, so retain the dependency-defined S79 through S88 repair boundaries |
| 2026-10-01 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S79 | Record 1 elapsed workday against 11 estimated for three completed contribution stories. Reviewed PR increments and existing geometry, story and binding gates reduced elapsed integration time while the full verification and sprint review remained explicit. The resulting 15.00 stories per week is not a sustainable forecast, so retain the dependency-defined S80 through S88 repair boundaries |
| 2026-10-02 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S80 | Record 2 elapsed workdays against 13 estimated for three completed contribution stories. Reviewed contributor increments, dependency-prefix integration and established binding and viewer gates reduced authoring time while the full verification and sprint review remained explicit. The resulting 7.50 stories per week is a short contribution-intake result, so retain the dependency-defined S81 through S88 repair boundaries |
| 2026-10-02 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S81 | Record 1 elapsed workday against 15 estimated for three completed dependency waves.

| 2026-10-02 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S82 | Record 1 elapsed workday against 13 estimated for three completed acceptance and evidence stories.

| 2026-10-02 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S83 | Record 1 elapsed workday against 8 estimated for two completed dependency waves.

| 2026-10-03 | Sprint estimate variance exceeded 30 percent | S84 | Record 2 elapsed workdays against 38 estimated for ten completed stories. This deliberately combined the S84 through S89 repair scope to pay the full-test cost once.

## S79 contribution reconciliation

The five assigned PRs, 220, 222, 225, 236 and 237, are superseded by the reviewed F-X153, F-X146 and F-X152 integrations on `main`. Close each with contributor credit and a link to the integrated sprint merge. Close Issues 162 and 227 after their complete layout and diff reproducers pass. Close Issues 163 and 172 after their direct body coordinate and inline control comment entry point regressions pass. Keep Issue 226 open for the plain-line trailing-space fit in F-X163. Keep Issue 168 open for the remaining production checklist in F-X147 and tolerant reads in F-X160. Comment on both open issues with the completed S79 work and the remaining acceptance scope.

## S80 contribution reconciliation

PRs 218 and 223 were closed as superseded by F-X154. PRs 219, 221, 224, 230 and 234 were closed as superseded by F-X155. Each received an individual comment thanking hadim and linking the pushed S80 merge at `bc700efb`.

Issues 215 and 216 were closed after their preservation and line-separator regressions passed. Issue 168 was closed after the complete Word Python chain passed and the reporter-accepted lxml package-write fallback was documented and exercised. Issue 217 remains open for F-X156 slide import and scoped replacement, followed by F-X157 complete deck-chain acceptance in S81. The accepted S80 LibreOffice and python-pptx evidence does not claim a PowerPoint 16.104 observation.

## S81 contribution reconciliation

PRs [231](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/231#issuecomment-5950014500), [235](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/235#issuecomment-5950024422) and [238](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/238#issuecomment-5950035288) were closed as superseded by the pushed S81 merge at `58e41809`. Each received an individual note thanking hadim, naming the integrated result and explaining its remaining scope.

Issues [169](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/169#issuecomment-5950044534) and [217](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/217#issuecomment-5950052508) remain open. Their S81 comments cite the production and six-item deck-chain evidence on `main`. F-X158 in S82 still owns the reporter's exported deck fixture and criterion-level closure check. The accepted viewer evidence uses pinned LibreOffice 26.2.5.2 and python-pptx 1.0.2 and does not claim a PowerPoint 16.104 observation.

## S82 issue reconciliation

No contributed PR was assigned to the S82 fixture and evidence wave. The verified [S82 main merge](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/commit/470e3781811f34044d9a3acb2f5cb8af2d09a65b) carries all three completed F-IDs. Issues [156](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/156#issuecomment-5957215809), [164](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/164#issuecomment-5957230429), [166](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/166#issuecomment-5957233694), [169](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/169#issuecomment-5957237108), [170](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/170#issuecomment-5957245288) and [217](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/217#issuecomment-5957248701) received individual evidence and reporter-credit comments and were closed.

Issues [158](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/158#issuecomment-5957255636), [160](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/160#issuecomment-5957258109) and [226](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/226#issuecomment-5957260298) remain open. F-X161 in S84 owns the compact Word part and namespace gap in Issue 160. F-X163 was scheduled in S86 at S82 close and is now in S84 for the plain-line spacing gap in Issue 226. Issue [163](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/163#issuecomment-5957261891) remains closed after its missing bookmark-after-table evidence passed on the S82 main merge. The original 22-issue ledger now has 19 passing rows and three unresolved rows.

## S83 contribution and issue reconciliation

The verified [S83 main merge](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/commit/ea3fdbe1dd534a088c2be36f146fa945ee81cd9e) carries F-X159 and F-X160. PRs [240](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/240#issuecomment-5959494283), [248](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/248#issuecomment-5959495610), [249](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/249#issuecomment-5959496595) and [250](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/250#issuecomment-5959497876) received individual contributor-credit comments and were closed as superseded by the integrated work. PR 249's broader `insert_document` remapping question remains outside the same-part drawing-ID fix.

Issues [243](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/243#issuecomment-5959533687), [246](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/246#issuecomment-5959534625) and [247](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/247#issuecomment-5959535490) received reporter-credit comments citing the integrated regression and direct Python or CLI evidence and were closed. Both Issue 243 reporter packages passed. Issue 160 remains open for F-X161's compact edited-part and namespace criteria in S84, and Issue 245 remains open for that same serialization work.

## S89 contribution reconciliation

PR [269](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/269), contributed by Changjoon (`changjoon-park`), is superseded by the F-X177 integration at `8cced41d`. The original memmap compile reproducer fails before the fix and passes after it. Default, no-default, memmap and no-default plus memmap configurations passed on the integrated tree. Close the PR after pushing the S89 main merge, with an individual thank-you comment linking the integration and the sprint merge. No separate issue was assigned to S89. Issue 264's declarative authoring discussion remains open and outside this sprint's acceptance scope.

## S90 contribution reconciliation

PR [271](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/pull/271), contributed by Hadrien
Mary (`hadim`), is integrated through F-X179 with an additional reviewed fix
for nested legacy reply removal. Every [Issue 270](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/270)
criterion passes, including XML parent and done rows and multiline authoring
through all existing entry points. Reconcile both records only after the
verified S90 merge is pushed through `/close-sprint`, with contributor thanks
and links to the feature integration and main merge. Issue 264 is excluded.


Issue [281](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/281), raised by Hadrien
Mary (`hadim`), is assessed in the existing F-184 decision at S95. The go
requires a material combined-lifecycle gap and an explicit preserve, edit and
execute boundary. The roadmap stages reading and loss-aware editing before
calculation and pivots. Rendering and distribution remain scheduled for S104.
The request for a unified CLI/Python workflow and an earlier usable package
adds integration and release tradeoffs to that decision. The existing
[maintainer response](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/281#issuecomment-6058792996)
answers those questions and invites concrete workflows and preservation needs.
Keep the discussion open for F-184 and reconcile this existing response during
verified S90 sprint close.

The [reporter follow-up](https://github.com/tensorbee/rdocx/issues/281#issuecomment-6063901190)
adds concrete Google Sheets review requirements: byte-preserve unmodeled
comment metadata, validation, conditional formatting and names, read typed
cells and formula caches, edit with styles and atomic output, and keep shared
formulas intact. Explicit stale-cache handling is required. The first-cut
alternatives are recalculate-on-load or a bounded basic evaluator. Unified
installation and API shape, Rust performance and safety, and later rendering
are the differentiators. Chart authoring is not requested. HLD14 and the S95
plan retain these inputs without starting conditional spreadsheet work in S90
or changing the reviewed release boundary. Keep Issue281 open for F-184.
